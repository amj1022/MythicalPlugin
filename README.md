## Introduction

This plugin is still in early development phases. The purpose of this being to add features to enhance gameplay in Minecraft. In its current stage of development the features are limited to wands.

## Features

- Wands added of various types
- Wands have the ability to have a firework visual effect along with a splash potion effect
- Bukkit / Spigot API

## Usage

To get the plugin running, the user who is responsible for hosting the server will place the jar file into the plugins folder that was generated from creating the server. 

From there, the server will need to either be launched with the run.bat file or by reloading the server by using "/reload" in the in-game console.

In game, the user can either type "/wands" for all wands or "/[wand name]" for a specific wand in the console to obtain wands.

The jar file will later be placed on BuiltByBit for usage.
